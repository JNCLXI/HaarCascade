# Android Haar Cascade Implementation App

I did participate in this project as a freshman on new year's eve in 2019 at the ABAC CODE CAMP X 2019 workshop. I can't do much at that moment with the current stage 
of knowledge but I did learn a lot from this project and I did complete it at least, with the help of thanathasCh (https://github.com/thanathasCh) who did teach, advice 
and help me out when I actually hard stuck at some point. My team consisted of 3 people, my part was an Android developer and tester.

How does this thing work? 
1) When you open an app, it is going to act like the actual camera. 
2) Next up, when there is some humanoid like object pass by it is going to have some kind of green frame around the object which it is detected with the Haar Cascade object      recognition algorithm.
3) For each trigger of the Haar cascade algorithm or the appearance of the green frame it is going to count and reccord it on the database platformn which is going to be
   firebase since it is easy for implementation and take less time to set it up.

Purpose of this project? 

To measure the traffic of people or how populate is it at a period of time within that area. The collected data might be used for a further data analysis to manage or 
adapt the resources such as human resources according to the data so that it can be efficient for the business owners.
